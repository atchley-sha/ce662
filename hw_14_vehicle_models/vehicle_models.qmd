The car I chose for this problem set is a 2005 Chevrolet Corvette C6 Z06.
This is a 6-speed manual transmission car with a 427.8 in^3^ V8 engine.
An example of this car is shown in @fig-car.

```{r}
#| label: data

pmaxhp <- 504 #hp
pmaxrpm <- 6300 #rpm
tmaxlbft <- 467 # lb-ft
tmaxrpm <- 4800 #rpm

pmax <- pmaxhp*745.7 # W
pmaxr <- pmaxrpm*0.1047198 #rad/sec
tmax <- tmaxlbft*1.3558 # N-m
tmaxr <- tmaxrpm*0.1047198 #rad/sec

g1r <- 2.66
g2r <- 1.78
g3r <- 1.30
g4r <- 1
g5r <- 0.74
g6r <- 0.5
gRr <- 2.90
fdar <- 3.42

ftire <- "P275/35ZR18"
rtire <- "P325/30ZR19"

ft <- (18/2*25.4 + 275*0.35)/1000
rt <- (19/2*25.4 + 325*0.30)/1000

wt <- 3132 #lb

width <- 75.9 #in (no mirrors)
height <- 49.0 #in (with or without tires?)
```

# 20.1

The following are specifications for the vehicle:

a. Final drive axle ratio: `r fdar`:1
b. 1^st^ gear ratio: `r g1r`:1
c. 6^th^ gear ratio: `r g6r`:1
d. Tire specification: `r ftire` (front), `r rtire` (rear)
e. Base curb weight: `r wt` lb

# 20.2

```{r}
vs <- 30 #m/s
Nf <- g6r*fdar

find_omega <- function(v, N, r){
  v * 30 * N / pi / r
}

num <- vs*30*Nf

omega <- find_omega(vs, Nf, rt)
```

Given that the vehicle speed is related to engine speed as in @eq-speed-relation, where $r$ is the tire radius and $N_{\text{ft}}$ is the final transmission gear ratio, the vehicle cruising at `r vs` m/s in 6^th^ gear has an engine speed of $`r round(num,1)`/\pi r$ m/s (the final gear ratio is $`r g6r` \times `r fdar` = `r round(g6r*fdar,2)`$).

$$
v = \frac{\pi r}{30N_{\text{ft}}}\omega
$$ {#eq-speed-relation}

Since this is a rear-wheel drive car, the rear tire radius will be used for $r$.
This is $19"/2 + 0.3 \times 325\ \text{mm} = `r round(rt,3)`$ m.
The engine speed is therefore $`r round(num,1)`/`r round(rt,3)`\pi = `r round(omega)`$ rad/s.
