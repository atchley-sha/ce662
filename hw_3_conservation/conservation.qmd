@tbl-tunnel shows vehicle counts from the Lincoln Tunnel's `r distance`-mile long south tunnel.
The counts are binned by hour over a 24-hour period, and are for both entering and exiting vehicles.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-tunnel
#| tbl-cap: Lincoln Tunnel Vehicle Counts

tunnel %>% 
  flextable(col_keys = c("time", "vin", "vout")) %>% 
  set_header_labels(time = "Time", vin = "Vehicles\nEntering", vout = "Vehicles\nExiting") %>% 
  colformat_datetime(fmt_datetime = "%H:%M") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  align(align = "c", part = "a") 
```

The level of service (LOS) of the tunnel is determined by the density, as shown in @tbl-los.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-los
#| tbl-cap: LOS of Highway Segment

los %>% 
  flextable(col_keys = c("los", "label")) %>% 
  set_header_labels(los = "LOS", label = "Density (veh/mi/lane)") %>% 
  colformat_md(j = label) %>%
  autofit() %>% 
  align(align = "c", part = "a")
```

For each hour, the density is calculated from the number of vehicles in the tunnel.
This is given by the difference in cumulative entering vehicles and cumulative exiting vehicles.
The tunnel is `r distance` miles in length and has `r nlanes` lanes, so the density per lane is given by $k_l = \frac{N_\text{tunnel}}{`r distance`\times `r nlanes`}$.
@tbl-calc-tunnel shows this for each hour.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-calc-tunnel
#| tbl-cap: Density and LOS Calculations for Lincoln Tunnel

calc_tunnel %>% 
  flextable(col_keys = c("time", "sum_vin", "sum_vout", "vtunnel", "dens", "dens_lane", "los")) %>% 
  set_header_labels(
    time = "Time", 
    sum_vin = "Cumulative\nVehicles Entering",
    sum_vout = "Cumulative\nVehicles Exiting",
    vtunnel = "Vehicles In&NewLine;Tunnel (En&minus;Ex)",
    dens = "Density\n(veh/mi)",
    dens_lane = "Lane Density\n(veh/mi/lane)",
    los = "Level of\nService"
  ) %>% 
  colformat_datetime(fmt_datetime = "%H:%M") %>% 
  colformat_double(j = ~ dens + dens_lane, digits = 2) %>% 
  colformat_md(j = vtunnel, part = "h") %>%
  autofit() %>% 
  align(align = "c", part = "a") %>% 
  fit_to_width(6.5) 
```

# 5.3

```{r}
#| include: false

length <- 2 #miles
vehlen <- 29.3 #feet
qinhwy <- 2600 #vph
qinramp <- 400 #vph
qo <- 1800 #vph
nlanes <- 2
starttime <- hours(8) %>% as_datetime() #8:00 AM
# %>% format("%H:%M %p")

qin <- qinhwy + qinramp
nvehlane <- ((length*5280)/vehlen) %>% floor()

```


A crash on Interstate 91 occurred at `r starttime %>% format("%H:%M %p")`, blocking one of the `r nlanes` lanes and reducing the discharge rate of the highway segment to `r qo` vehicles per hour.
The inflow to this segment is `r qinhwy` vehicles per hour.
Additionally, `r length` miles ahead of the crash is an on-ramp with an inflow of `r qinramp` vehicles per hour.
See @fig-crash for a depiction.

```{r}
#| label: fig-crash
#| fig-cap: Depiction of the section of I-91 with the crash.

knitr::include_graphics("crash.png")
```

The Massachusetts Department of Transportation wants to avoid vehicles backing up to the on-ramp, which will happen at some point since the inflow is greater than the discharge.
Assuming a consistent vehicle spacing (front bumper to front bumper) of `r vehlen` feet, the `r length`-mile segment will be backed up when there are `r nvehlane` vehicles in each lane.
Because there are `r nlanes` lanes, when `r nveh` vehicles are in this segment the highway will be backed up to the on-ramp.
The difference in inflow and discharge is `r qdiff` vehicles per hour, so this will occur in `r buhours` hours or `r bumin` minutes.
This means that the Department of Transportation has until `r butime %>% format("%H:%M %p")` to clear the crash before the highway is backed up to the on-ramp.
