@fig-annotated-qk shows an annotated flow-density curve with the following: (a) $v_f = `r vf`$ kph; (b) $k_j = `r kj`$ v/km; (c) $q_m=`r qm`$ vph, $k_m=`r km`$ v/km, $v_m=`r vm`$ kph; (d) $q_A=`r qA`$ vph, $k_A=`r kA`$ v/km, $v_A=`r vA`$ kph; (e) \$q_B=`r qB` \$vph, $k_B=`r kB`$ v/km, $v_B=`r vB`$ kph; (f) $w_f=`r wf`$ kph, $w_j=`r wj`$ kph, $w_m=`r wm`$ kph, $w_a=`r wA`$ kph, $w_B=`r wB`$ kph; (g) $U_{AB}=`r UAB`$ kph.

Traffic on a 16-km stretch of Interstate 90 is observing the flow-density relationship as seen in @fig-annotated-qk.
The traffic is initially operating at condition B.
At 07:00PM the demand upstream of the midpoint of this segment drops and traffic begins to operate at condition A.
See @fig-graph-2 for a time-space diagram depicting this.
At 07:30PM the traffic (b) 2km upstream and (a) 2km downstream of the midpoint are both operating under condition B.
(c) The queue will reach the upstream end of this segment when the shockwave $AB$ has traveled 8 km.
Because the speed of the shockwave $U_{AB}$ is `r abs(UAB)` kph, this will happen after `r time` minutes, or at `r endtime %>% format("%R")`PM.

*An intelligent transportation system problem.* On Wednesday at 9:00 a.m., there is an accident on northbound Interstate 91.
The traffic operation center (TOC) has to decide how to clean up the accident.
After collecting information and communicating with highway patrol and emergency operator, the TOC determines that there are two alternatives:

1.  Completely shut Interstate 91 for 10 minutes, clean it up, and then reopen Interstate 91 for normal operation.
2.  Partially open Interstate 91 at reduced capacity, but the cleanup requires 30 minutes before normal operation can resume.

@tbl-crash-conditions gives the flow, density, and speed for each relevant traffic condition on this segment of the I-91.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-crash-conditions
#| tbl-cap: Traffic Conditions on I-91

q <- c(2000,0,2200,1100) %>% 
  `names<-`(c("A", "D", "C", "E"))
k <- c(40,200,60,145) %>% 
  `names<-`(c("A", "D", "C", "E"))

conditions <- tribble(
  ~Condition, ~Description,
  "A", "Arrival Flow",
  "D", "Queued Flow",
  "C", "Capacity Flow",
  "E", "Reduced Flow",
) %>% 
  bind_cols(q = q,k = k) %>% 
  mutate(v = round(q/k, 1))

conditions %>%
  flextable() %>% 
  set_header_labels(q = "q (vph)", k = "k (v/km)", v = "v (kph)") %>% 
  align(align = 'c', part = 'a') %>% 
  autofit()
```

```{r}
#| include: false
U <- c()
U["AD"] <- (q["A"] - q["D"])/(k["A"] - k["D"])
U["CD"] <- (q["C"] - q["D"])/(k["C"] - k["D"])
U["AE"] <- (q["A"] - q["E"])/(k["A"] - k["E"])
U["CE"] <- (q["C"] - q["E"])/(k["C"] - k["E"])

tclose <- abs((10/60)*U["CD"]/(U["CD"] - U["AD"]))
dclose <- abs(tclose*U["AD"])

treduce <- abs((30/60)*U["CE"]/(U["CE"] - U["AE"]))
dreduce <- abs(treduce*U["AE"])
```

@fig-crash-close shows a time-space diagram for alternative 1, where the interstate is closed for 10 minutes.

![Time-space diagram of closing I-91 for 10 minutes.](crash_close.png){#fig-crash-close height="3.5in"}

The point $(t,d)$ where the shockwaves $AD$ and $CD$ intersect is the solution to the equation $d = U_{AD}t = U_{CD}(t-\frac{10}{60})$.
Given that $U_{AD} = `r U["AD"] %>% round(1)`$ and $U_{CD} = `r U["CD"] %>% round(1)`$, we find that $(t,d) = (`r tclose %>% round(2)`,`r dclose %>% round()`)$.

@fig-crash-reduce shows a time-space diagram for alternative 2, where the flow on the interstate is reduced for 30 minutes.

![Time-space diagram of reducing flow on  I-91 for 30 minutes.](crash_reduced.png){#fig-crash-reduce height="3.5in"}

The point $(t,d)$ where the shockwaves $AE$ and $CE$ intersect is the solution to the equation $d = U_{AE}t = U_{CE}(t-\frac{30}{60})$.
Given that $U_{AE} = `r U["AE"] %>% round(1)`$ and $U_{CE} = `r U["CE"] %>% round(1)`$, we find that $(t,d) = (`r treduce %>% round(2)`,`r dreduce %>% round()`)$.

As it turns out, the total queue length will be shorter for alternative 1, where the interstate is closed for 10 minutes.
