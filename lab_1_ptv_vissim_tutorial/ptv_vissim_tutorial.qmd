I created a working local simulation of the Vissim "First Steps" model by following the steps in the tutorial.
This model is of an intersection near the PTV Group headquarters in Karlsruhe, Germany.
See @fig-site for imagery of the site.

Each iteration of the simulation ran for 30 minutes after a 5-minute startup period in order to allow the network to become loaded.
The simulation ran for 10 iterations, and the delay measurements are presented in @tbl-delay.
